SCOL-R
======

SCOL-R (Shareable Cross Origin Learning Resources) is a set of libraries that helps you connect pedagogical content with an LMS through the SCORM API even when the two are on different domains.

It is mainly based on HTML5's `postMessage` function.

The SCORM Adapter intends to be compatible with SCORM versions 1.2 and 2004.

To get started, set the remote content's URL in the `body`'s `data-source` attribute in index.html, and an `imsmanifest.xml` file with one resource pointing to index.html, zip it all up and upload it to an LMS.
